#ifndef ASTEROIDZ_RULE_SCHEMA_H
#define ASTEROIDZ_RULE_SCHEMA_H

/* A machine-readable description of every window-rule field.
 *
 * Same problem config-schema.h solves, one level down. A rule editor has to know
 * that `app-id` is a REGEX and not a literal, that `isfloating` has three states
 * and not two, that `tags` is written 1..9 but stored as a bitmask, and that
 * `width` under 1.0 means a fraction of the screen. None of that is derivable
 * from the parsed struct: `ConfigWinRule` is int32_t after int32_t, and the two
 * facts that distinguish them -- tri-state versus boolean, regex versus literal
 * -- are conventions held in the reader's head.
 *
 * It also replaces kdl_rule_map[], which carried pretty KDL names for eleven of
 * the fifty-three and fell through to the bare key for the rest. Two tables that
 * had to agree, one of them 80% empty. Now the nice name lives beside the key it
 * maps to and "the schema and the KDL spelling disagree" is not a representable
 * state -- the same move that folded kdl_key_map[] into config_schema[].
 *
 * Both spellings keep working. `nice` is canonical for writing and for the docs;
 * the underscore key is still accepted, because kdl_rule_key falls through
 * unchanged when nothing matches and years of configs are written that way.
 *
 * Checked from both ends, like the option schema:
 *   - `asteroidz -R` drives the REAL windowrule parser: every field is written
 *     through parse_option and read back through its own offset, so a wrong
 *     offset or type is a red test rather than a rule that silently sets its
 *     neighbour.
 *   - what a dynamic check cannot cover -- a key `parse_option` handles that
 *     is MISSING here -- is a comparison of `-R` against the parser, by hand.
 *
 * Writing it turned up drift that had been there a while: six fields the parser
 * accepts were in no documentation at all (force_hdr, isnotitlebar, nofocus,
 * noscanout, privacy_shield, vrr_only_fullscreen), and `single_scratchpad`
 * was documented as a window rule the parser has never accepted.

	 * with v0 == 0, and started the new segment from rest. The stall the
	 * velocity-continuity work existed to remove survived in exactly the turn
	 * that shows it most.
	 *
	 * Four axes, four independent springs, four v0s. Each axis carries its own
	 * outgoing speed and none of them is projected away. The old comment here

	 *
	 * That is not hypothetical: the first version of the velocity-continuity
	 * code computed the outgoing velocity from `current - initial` at retarget

 * alt-tabbed away from goes static immediately -- so a 12.8s excursion still
 * cost a modeset going out and another coming back, the same pair as the fixed
 * wait it replaced, just sooner.
 *
 * What the gate was missing is that being below the floor is not the same as

 * over a sustained idle desktop, not instant; the operator ran 12h42m clean
 * once VRR was off. So a brief dip below the floor is not a reason to spend a
 * modeset.
 *
 * THIS IS NOT THE FIXED WAIT COMING BACK, and the distinction is the whole
 * argument: AZ_VRR_OFF_DEBOUNCE_MS was a guess about how long a PERSON
 * alt-tabs for, and no measurement of the machine could ever have chosen it.
 * This is how long this PANEL tolerates running below its own floor, which is
 * a display property like the 48Hz itself and is measurable -- leave adaptive
 * sync on an idle desktop and time the first blank.
 *
 * PROVISIONAL AT 20s, and labelled so rather than presented as derived. That
 * measurement has not been run: it means deliberately provoking the fault on
 * the operator's own display. 20s covers every excursion measured so far
 * (8.8, 9.3, 12.8, 13.8) and is far short of the sustained idle the blanking
 * was seen over. vrr_below_floor_max_ms records the longest stretch adaptive
 * sync actually survived, so if a blank does happen there is a number to

/*
 * ── A RULE CHANGE THAT DOES NOT NEED A RESTART ────────────────────────────
 *
 * Reported by the operator as "some of these flags don't reconfigure the
 * compositor live". They were right, and it was not a small gap:
 * apply_rule_properties() ran only from applyrules(), applyrules() ran only at
 * map, and config_apply_live() -- which re-applies keyboard, pointer, cursor,
 * blur, master, tag rules, monitor rules, border colours and X11 scale --
 * never re-ran window rules at all. It cost a wrong diagnosis in this session:
 * a `no-scanout 1` rule added live, reloaded, reported success, and did
 * nothing.
 *
 * ── WHY THE RESET COMES FIRST ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * APPLY_INT_PROP is `if (rule->prop >= 0) obj->prop = rule->prop`. It only
 * writes when a rule SPECIFIES a value, so re-running rules alone would let a
 * property be added live and never removed -- delete `no-blur` from a rule,
 * reload, and the window stays unblurred until it is closed. Resetting to the
 * defaults first is what makes removal expressible.
 *
 * ── AND WHY NOT init_client_properties() ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * That is the existing defaults function and it is NOT safe on a live client:
 * it nulls overview_scene_surface, re-arms is_pending_open_animation, and
 * zeroes float_geom -- which would discard every floating window's remembered
 * geometry on every reload. It resets lifecycle state as well as rule state,
 * and only the second half belongs here.
 *
 * Seven of these are reset by nothing at all today (force_hdr, privacy_shield,
 * vrr_only_fullscreen, isnotitlebar, and both animation_type_*). That is
 * harmless at map, where the client is freshly zeroed, and would be a silent
 * hole here.

		 * to SDR and hand over gamma2.2/BT.709 -- which the compositor then
		 * re-encoded to PQ for the panel. AVK's PQ decode was unreachable for
		 * that reason alone and nothing in the renderer could have fixed it.
		 *
		 * ── AND WHY THIS IS BUILT FROM wlroots ENUMS, NOT PROTOCOL ONES ────
		 *
		 * wlr_color_manager_v1_transfer_function_to_wlr() ABORTS when a
		 * protocol value has no matching wlroots entry, and scenefx calls it on
		 * whatever a client attaches (surface.c's surface_reconfigure). So
		 * advertising a protocol value wlroots cannot map does not degrade --
		 * it kills the compositor as soon as any client uses it, which at login
		 * is immediately.
		 *
		 * Starting from wlroots' OWN enum values and mapping outward with
		 * _from_wlr() (which has no such abort) makes that impossible by
		 * construction: every value advertised came from a wlroots entry, so a
		 * matching entry necessarily exists on the way back. The defensive
		 * alternative -- calling _to_wlr() to check -- would be calling the
		 * aborting function to find out whether it aborts.

		 * function, so it lives until display teardown and could never have
		 * shared a session with a second manager anyway. Two live
		 * wp_color_manager_v1 globals would both appear in the registry with
		 * clients binding whichever they saw first.
		 *
		 * The capability set is built once, in az_cm_caps.h, from wlroots' own

/*
 * ── WHICH WINDOW DECIDES, AND WHY IT IS NOT THE FOCUSED ONE ───────────────
 *
 * This followed keyboard focus, and that is the wrong owner for the question.
 * Adaptive sync is a property of the OUTPUT: it should be on when something on
 * that display wants its cadence to drive the refresh rate, and focus is not
 * that. check_vrr_enable() is called with NULL whenever focus is cleared --
 * a layer-shell surface taking the keyboard, a popup, a notification -- and
 * with a non-game client whenever focus lands on one.
 *
 * Under a global `vrr 1` that never showed, because the global pinned it on and
 * the toggle never changed the committed status. Under dynamic VRR it showed
 * immediately: a live session logged 18 adaptive-sync resets during one game,
 * in on/off pairs 7 to 16 seconds apart, each one a real modeset and each one a
 * visible blank. The operator reported it as the display resetting while
 * playing.
 *
 * So the answer comes from the output. A fullscreen GAME-class window stays
 * fullscreen and visible while a popup borrows the keyboard, so the answer does
 * not change and nothing is committed.
 *
 * STILL GATED ON FULLSCREEN. A windowed game shares the output with a blinking
 * cursor and a clock, and letting it drive the refresh rate makes everything
 * else on that display stutter. Fullscreen is what makes "this client's cadence
 * is the output's cadence" true.
 *
 * `vrr_only_fullscreen` still means exactly what it meant. What M13 generalised
 * is the other way in: a window whose presentation class is GAME -- because it
 * said so through wp-content-type, or because a presentation-class rule says so
 * -- wants VRR for the same reason, and naming every game in the config was the
 * gap.

 *
 * NEAREST, not the default bilinear. The whole point is that the buffer is
 * already the right number of pixels, so no filtering should be needed at
 * all -- and where the renderer's edge rounding leaves a fractional pixel
 * (see below), nearest duplicates one texel row while bilinear smears the
 * entire image. A filter that is never asked to interpolate costs nothing;
 * one that is asked to interpolate everything is exactly the blur this
 * option exists to remove. It is set per buffer and survives a reconfigure,
 * so it does not have to be re-applied on every commit.
 *
 * ── THE HONEST CAVEAT ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * 1:1 is exact only where both edges of the window's logical box land on
 * whole device pixels. AVK converts a logical box to the output raster by
 * rounding each EDGE and subtracting (az_avk_box_to_output), which is what
 * makes adjacent windows meet without a seam -- but at 1.25x or 1.5x it also
 * means a window at an odd logical position can come out one device pixel
 * wider or narrower than its buffer. With NEAREST that is a single
 * duplicated or dropped texel row at one edge, which is what Hyprland's
 * force_zero_scaling does too. A fullscreen window -- the case this option
 * is for -- starts at 0 and is exact. A dst-snap refinement in AVK could
 * remove the remainder; it is deliberately not attempted here.

 * ── WHICH MONITOR AN X11 WINDOW IS MEASURED IN ───────────────────────────

 * tooltip, a drag icon, a splash -- never goes through setmon at all and has
 * no monitor of its own, so it has to be attributed.
 *
 * THE OBVIOUS ANSWER, LOOKING UP ITS POSITION, IS AMBIGUOUS BY CONSTRUCTION.
 * With this option on, each monitor's X11 zone is its logical box multiplied
 * by its OWN scale, and those products overlap on a mixed-DPI layout: a
 * 1920x1080 output at 1.25 is logical 0..1536 and X11 0..1920, while the
 * output starting at logical 1536 with scale 1 is X11 1536..3456. X11
 * coordinate 1700 is inside both zones and there is no arithmetic that can
 * say which one meant it.
 *
 * A POPUP'S PARENT IS NOT AMBIGUOUS. It is a managed window with a monitor,
 * and a menu belongs to the window that opened it. That is also the only
 * answer that keeps parent and popup in the SAME unit -- the client computed
 * the offset between them itself, and it is only correct if both are measured
 * the same way. So the parent is asked first, and the zone lookup is the
 * fallback for a window that has none. Its first match wins, in monitor
 * order: a stated, repeatable rule rather than whichever one happened to be

	 *
	 * The preferred-description half of the handshake was never missing here.
	 * That is sent from mapnotify() and setmon(), both of which XWayland
	 * already shares, so this one call is the whole of the gap.

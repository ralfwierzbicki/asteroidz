 * This is not a wlr_renderer. It does not include one, it cannot be passed to
 * one, and nothing under src/render/vulkan/ may include a wlroots renderer,
 * EGL or GLES header -- meson enforces that with an include check, because the
 * whole point of this subsystem is that its design is not shaped by an
 * abstraction built for GLES. See docs/architecture.md.
 *
 * The layer is deliberately compositor-agnostic: its inputs are DRM file
 * descriptors, dmabuf file descriptors and pixels. That is what makes it
 * testable without a compositor -- opening a render node
 * and drives the whole thing with no Wayland display anywhere.
